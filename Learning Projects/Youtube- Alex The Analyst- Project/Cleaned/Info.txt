Cleaning was done in Microsoft Excel instead of Power BI, and also further cleaning was completed deviating from the advice given in the tutorial.


-Country-to-Continent Mapping
In this dataset, most countries were grouped by their respective continents to simplify analysis. However, the following countries were retained as individual categories:
United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore
Rationale:
Significant Global Influence: These countries have large economies, high digital engagement, and strong presence in global markets.
Distinctive Behavioral Patterns: Their technological, cultural, and socioeconomic profiles differ substantially from regional averages.
High Data Representation: These nations frequently appear in global datasets and are analytically meaningful on their own.
This approach balances clarity and granularity, enabling continent-level insights while preserving detail for countries with outsized impact.


-Adjustment of the 0–40k Salary Range
The salary range 0–40k was adjusted to 10–40k for average calculation purposes.
Rationale:
Avoids skew from unpaid roles or missing data represented by the 0k lower bound.
Produces a more realistic midpoint that reflects typical entry-level earnings.
Maintains consistency with how other salary ranges are treated.
This change ensures the computed averages better represent actual compensation levels.


-Job Title-to-Category Mapping
In this dataset, job titles were consolidated into eight core categories to simplify analysis and reduce redundancy. However, the following categories were retained as distinct groups:
Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, Software Engineer / Database Developer, Student / Looking / None, Other
Rationale:
Functional Distinction: These roles differ significantly in responsibilities, skills, and tooling (e.g., engineering vs. analysis vs. leadership).
High Frequency: Titles like Data Analyst and Data Engineer occur frequently and are central to most data teams.
Clarity in Reporting: Separating leadership roles (Manager, Director), education status (Student/Looking), and technical specializations (BI, Software, Database) enhances interpretability.
Role-Specific Trends: These categories reflect distinct hiring trends, salary patterns, and job functions—grouping them maintains analytic precision.
This approach balances simplicity with analytical depth, enabling streamlined dashboards while preserving critical differences across job functions.
