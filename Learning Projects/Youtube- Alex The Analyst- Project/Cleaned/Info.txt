Cleaning was done in Microsoft Excel instead of Power BI, and also further cleaning was completed deviating from the advice given in the tutorial.


-Country-to-Continent Mapping
In this dataset, most countries were grouped by their respective continents to simplify analysis. However, the following countries were retained as individual categories:
United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore
Rationale:
Significant Global Influence: These countries have large economies, high digital engagement, and strong presence in global markets.
Distinctive Behavioral Patterns: Their technological, cultural, and socioeconomic profiles differ substantially from regional averages.
High Data Representation: These nations frequently appear in global datasets and are analytically meaningful on their own.


This approach balances clarity and granularity, enabling continent-level insights while preserving detail for countries with outsized impact.
-Adjustment of the 0–40k Salary Range
The salary range 0–40k was adjusted to 10–40k for average calculation purposes.
Rationale:
Avoids skew from unpaid roles or missing data represented by the 0k lower bound.
Produces a more realistic midpoint that reflects typical entry-level earnings.
Maintains consistency with how other salary ranges are treated.
This change ensures the computed averages better represent actual compensation levels.
