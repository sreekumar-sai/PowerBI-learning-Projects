Rationale for Selecting Economically Significant Countries
In this dataset, certain countries have been deliberately excluded from being grouped into broader continental categories. Instead, they are preserved as individual entities due to their distinct global influence. The countries in question are:

United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Singapore.

These countries were selected based on the following considerations:

Global Economic Influence
Each of these countries represents a significant share of the global economy. They are members of international economic groups such as the G7, G20, or have been identified by institutions like the IMF and World Bank as key players in global financial and trade systems.

Technological and Digital Leadership
Many of these nations are leaders in technological innovation, internet infrastructure, and digital platform usage. This distinction often results in unique patterns in online behavior, market engagement, and consumer trends that justify treating them as separate analytical categories.

Sociopolitical and Cultural Distinction
These countries exhibit distinct social, political, and cultural dynamics that meaningfully differ from their continental peers. For example, post-Brexit United Kingdom operates with a different regulatory framework than the rest of Europe, and Indiaâ€™s vast, tech-savvy population demonstrates patterns that are not representative of broader Asia.

Overrepresentation in Global Datasets
These countries frequently account for a large portion of user responses or activity in global datasets, particularly in surveys, market research, and digital platforms. Their high visibility and participation levels make aggregation into a continental group analytically reductive.

By maintaining these countries as distinct entities, the dataset allows for more precise analysis and meaningful insights, while still organizing the remaining countries into appropriate continental groupings.
