# üìä Blinkit Sales Analysis ‚Äì Project Notes & Assumptions

This Power BI project analyzes Blinkit‚Äôs sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution using a dataset provided by [Data Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTutorials). The project follows a do-along format with custom modifications for learning and exploration.

## üßº Data Cleaning & Modifications

While the original tutorial used Power BI for data transformation, the following adjustments were made:

### ‚úÖ Cleaning Performed in Excel
- Initial cleaning and quality checks were done in **Microsoft Excel** before importing into Power BI.
- **Rationale**: Excel allowed for easier manual checks, filtering, and category consolidation during early exploration.

### ‚úÖ Chart Scope & KPI Adjustments
- Though the video covered specific KPIs (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating), additional grouping logic was applied to improve visual clarity and insight generation.

## üîç Chart-Specific Enhancements

In addition to the tutorial's walkthrough, custom groupings and assumptions were applied to chart development:

### 1. **Total Sales by Fat Content**
- Compared how low-fat vs. regular items influenced total revenue
- Used Donut Chart for simple KPI visualization

### 2. **Sales by Item Type**
- Grouped similar items to improve insight granularity
- Bar Chart used for categorical comparison

### 3. **Sales by Outlet Size**
- Correlated outlet size with overall sales performance
- Used Donut/Pie Chart to visually segment by size

### 4. **Sales by Outlet Location**
- Analyzed geographic distribution using Funnel Map
- Assessed sales skew by Tier 1/2/3 cities

### 5. **Sales by Outlet Establishment Year**
- Used Line Chart to observe performance trend by outlet age
- Explored possible impact of outlet maturity on revenue

### 6. **All Metrics by Outlet Type**
- Combined key KPIs into a Matrix card
- Useful for high-level executive overview

## üéì Learning Focus

- Building relationships between item-level and outlet-level data
- Writing DAX for aggregated measures (e.g., avg. rating, total sales)
- Designing dashboards with slicers for interactive filtering
- Understanding dimension vs. fact table relationships

## üìå Notes

- Dataset is used **strictly for educational purposes**  
- Project is **in progress**, and new visuals or metrics may be added later
